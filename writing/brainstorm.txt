So, we need to throw together an abstract that adequately summarizes our work. It should be around 500 words. 

Title: Alignment-free sequence analysis methods to cluster mycobacteriophages and infer evolutionary relationships

The way I see it, we have results from three main categories
tetranucleotide usage deviation(TUD)
	- phage within the same cluster show very similar TUD signitures 
	- clustering on TDI distance accurately reproduces clusters but not inter-cluster relationships
		- k-means clustering with 10-fold cross validation accurately clusters 97% 
		- Most incorrectly classified are singleton
		- Hierarchical clustering groups related phage closely, and sometimes near related clusters
	- TODO: compare TDI distance to alignment similarity (pairwis alignment is running for 60 hatful phage)
			different methods of clustering, improve model, regression, decision tree, etc
			MDS/PCA
			3-mers and 5-mers

tetranucleotide difference index (TDI)
	- shows trend along genome. similar phage show similar signals. 
	- TODO: find examples of horizontal transfer, look for similarity in TDI plot
			Normalize to first order markov insted of 3-mers
			3-mers and 5-mers
			can we use this for host-parisite coevolution?

other alignment-free methods (D2, D*2, T, R)
	- Need to check these out. shows huge potential for identifying horizontal gene transfer.

Mycobacteriophages are currently placed into clusters using methods the depend on sequence alignment and knowledge of gene position and homology. We used oligonucleotide usage deviation, the ratio of observed k-mers to the expected number under a zero order markov model, to infer relationships between phage genomes. Pairwise distances were calculated based on this statistic for all 663 mycobacteriophages currently on phagesdb. Several distance metrics
