So, we need to throw together an abstract that adequately summarizes our work. It should be around 500 words. 

Title: Alignment-free methods to infer evolutionary relationships and cluster mycobacteriophages?

The way I see it, we have results from three main categories
tetranucleotide usage deviation(TUD)
	- phage within the same cluster show very similar TDI signitures 
	- clustering on TDI distance accurately reproduces clusters but not inter-cluster relationships
		- k-means clustering with 10-fold cross validation accurately clusters 97% 
		- Most incorrectly classified are singleton
		- Hierarchical clustering groups related phage closely, and sometimes near related clusters
	- TODO: compare TDI distance to alignment similarity (pairwis alignment is running for 60 hatful phage)
			different methods of clustering, improve model, regression, decision tree, etc
			MDS/PCA
			3-mers and 5-mers

tetranucleotide difference index (TDI)
	- shows trend along genome. similar phage show similar signals. 
	- TODO: find examples of horizontal transfer, look for similarity in TDI plot
			Normalize to first order markov insted of 3-mers
			3-mers and 5-mers
			can we use this for host-parisite coevolution?

other alignment-free methods (D2, D*2, T, R)
	- Need to check these out. shows huge potential for identifying horizontal gene transfer.
